# Assignment 1: Ensemble Learning Model Comparison

## Project Overview
In this assignment, you will explore and compare the performance of three popular ensemble learning models: Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost. The objective is to fine-tune these models on three distinct datasets, perform necessary preprocessing steps, and analyze the results to draw valuable insights.

## Tasks
1. **Dataset Selection:**
   - Choose three diverse datasets suitable for classification or regression tasks from those provided on CMS.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Perform thorough data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and other necessary data cleaning procedures (at least 2 preprocessing steps per dataset).

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement RandomForest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost models using a suitable programming language (e.g., Python with scikit-learn).

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model using techniques such as grid search or random search. Optimize the models for the best performance on each dataset (fine-tune at least two parameters per model).

5. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train the tuned models on the respective datasets and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

6. **Comparison Table:**
   - Create a table summarizing the accuracy of each ensemble model on each dataset.

7. **Visualizations:**
   - **Accuracy Comparison Bar Chart:** Create a bar chart showing the accuracy of each ensemble model on different datasets for quick visual comparison.
   - **Grid Search Heatmap:** Create a heatmap where the x-axis represents the hyperparameter values of one parameter, the y-axis represents the hyperparameter values of another parameter, and the color in each cell represents the performance metric (select the highest accuracy model in each dataset for plotting).

8. **Insights and Conclusions:**
   - Report the results and draw insights from the comparison. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each ensemble model and how they perform on different types of datasets.
